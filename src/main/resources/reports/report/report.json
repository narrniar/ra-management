  "description": "The most severe issue is the `BeanCreationException`, which halts the application's startup. [cite: 11, 12, 13] This exception stems from Hibernate's attempt to cast a `JoinedSubclass` to a `RootClass`. [cite: 12, 13] In Hibernate, `JoinedSubclass` is used in joined table inheritance strategies, where subclasses map to separate database tables. [cite: 12] The `RootClass` represents the base entity in an inheritance hierarchy. [cite: 12] The `ClassCastException` suggests that Hibernate is encountering a subclass where it expects a root class, likely due to misconfiguration in the entity mappings. [cite: 12] This could involve errors in annotations such as `@Inheritance`, `@MappedSuperclass`, `@Entity`, or the relationships between entities.\n\nThe warning about deprecated API usage in `GoogleDriveService.java` indicates that the code is using outdated features that may be removed in future versions. [cite: 2, 3] To identify the specific deprecated APIs, the log suggests recompiling the code with the `-Xlint:deprecation` flag. [cite: 3] Addressing deprecated API usage is crucial for ensuring the application's long-term stability and compatibility.  \n\nThe Hibernate configuration warning advises against explicitly setting the `PostgreSQLDialect`. [cite: 11] Hibernate can automatically determine the correct dialect based on the database connection. [cite: 11] Removing the explicit dialect configuration simplifies the setup and aligns with Hibernate's best practices.",
